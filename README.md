      <body>
        <strong>TechPub</strong> is a New Zealand online store that sells electronics and tech accessories to customers all over the world. The business started in 2018 and has grown steadily since then. Like many online retailers, TechPub saw a big jump in demand during the COVID-19 years but now faces tougher competition and changing customer habits. <br><br>

        The company has built a customer base of around <strong>95,000</strong> people and has processed more than <strong>120,000</strong> orders, bringing in over <strong>$32 million</strong> in sales. The data used in this report covers the period from 2019 to 2022 and includes details on sales, products, regions, and loyalty programme activity. <br><br>

        This review was put together for the <strong>Head of Operations</strong> to give a clear picture of how the business has been performing and where improvements can be made. The findings will help the <strong>Sales team</strong> spot trends in customer buying behaviour, the <strong>Marketing team</strong> plan better campaigns and loyalty offers, and the <strong>Operations team</strong> improve order delivery and reduce refunds. <br><br>

        The analysis looks at several key areas of TechPub’s performance, listed below.
